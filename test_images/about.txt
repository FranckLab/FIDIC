Test images for stress and translation synthetically generated. The reference image is seeded with randomly placed "speckles" of gausian
intensity profile.  Progressive deformation is simulated by moving pixels approperiately.  To test with a simple 
translation, place the images from the "translation" directory here, to test a uniaxial stress deformation place 
the images in the "stress" directory here.

Shear images have been experimentally generated.

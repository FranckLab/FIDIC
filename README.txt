Description:  This package contains files for the Fast Iterative 
Digital Image Correlation algorithm

iterative digital volume correlation algorithm for large deformations. 
Experimental Mechanics. doi: 10.1007/s11340-014-9874-2

The main example file to see how the package runs is exampleRunFile.m.

Notes: Please ensure that the only .mat files in the working directory are those pertaining to the current image set.
Tested on MATLAB 2015a & 2015b for Windows x64, and MATLAB 2013a for Windows x64.  For our purposes we have validated the code
on the SEM 2014 DIC challenge images; use at your own risk.

History:    
0.13 - Release with several improvements: new plotting routine used by default "FIDIC_plot.m" with
       built-in region of interest selction for rectangular areas, 
       added a normalized cross-correlation option (with validation).  05/20/16
0.12 - New public release with minor updates: use interpn if griddedInterpolant is not found, 
       tiff2mat is now img2mat. Updated example dataset.  01/08/16
0.11 - Update of example run file to delete the .mat file generated by tiff2mat.m after use, 07/14/15
0.10 - Beta release of DIC adaptation, 06/25/15

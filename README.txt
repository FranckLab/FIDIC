Description:  This package contains files for the Fast Iterative 
Digital Image Correlation algorithm

The main example file to see how the package runs is exampleRunFile.m.

Notes: Please ensure that the only .mat files in the working directory are those pertaining to the current image set.
Tested on MATLAB 2015a & 2015b for Windows x64, and MATLAB 2013a for Windows x64.  For our purposes we have validated the code
on the SEM 2014 DIC challenge images; use at your own risk.
